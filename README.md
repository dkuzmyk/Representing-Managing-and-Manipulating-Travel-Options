# Representing-Managing-and-Manipulating-Travel-Options
Suppose you are planning a trip and have gathered a number of different options.  Each option has two traits which you care about (and these are the only traits you care about -- who cares about comfort and stuff like that?):  Price Travel time  Let us represent an option as an ordered-pair &lt;price, time>.  Now consider two options:  A: &lt;100, 120> : for $100, you can get to your destination in 120 minutes. B: &lt;200, 90>  : for $200, you can get to your destination in 90 minutes.  Which one should you pick?  In this case, it might depend on how rich, impatient and cheap you are.  Why?  Because, for these two options, we can see there is a tradeoff:  there is a reduction in travel time by spending more than $100.  On the other hand, consider these two options C and D:  C:  &lt;100, 110> : for $100, you can get to your destination in 110 minutes. D:  &lt;105, 130> : for $105, you can get to your destination in 130 minutes.  Option C is both cheaper and faster than option D.  Thus, nobody in their right mind would select option D over option C (again, price and time are the only criteria being considered).  In this situation, we say "C dominates D".
